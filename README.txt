BEFORE YOU BEGIN INSTALLING THIS PROGRAM 
SET UP virtual environment in your terminal before installing this script
to setup virtual-env in terminal execute the following commands in new fresh terminal windows:-
===========================================================================================================
Before you get started, make sure that you have Python 3
then execute 
"sudo apt install python3 python3-venv"
Python 3's venv functionality is built-in, and you can use it to get set up without anything else.
"python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/environment"
It will only take a few seconds to get set up. Once it's done, you can activate the virtual environment with:
"source your-project/bin/activate" (here your-project means virtual-project) here your command would be "source virtual-project/bin/activate" and to deactivate just change "activate" to "dactivate"
